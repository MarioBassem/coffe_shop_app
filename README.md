# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

The application can do the following:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## About the Stack

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains an Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
